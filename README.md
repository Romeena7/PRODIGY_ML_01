# PRODIGY_ML_01 â€“ House Price Prediction in India

A modular machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using clean code, reproducible workflows, and deployable models. Built for clarity, scalability, and portfolio impact.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses housing data from India to train a regression model that predicts property prices based on key features. It emphasizes:

- ðŸ”¹ Modular code structure
- ðŸ”¹ Reproducible environment setup
- ðŸ”¹ Deployment-ready model via Streamlit
- ðŸ”¹ Clean repo hygiene for public sharing
